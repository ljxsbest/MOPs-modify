/**
 * \mainpage The sweep particle simulation library
 * Sweep is generally referred to as sweepc (to distinguish it from an earlier
 * and now independent Fortran version).
 *
 * \section sweephistory History
 * Sweep is part of a larger suite of particle simulation software that
 * has its origins in the research group of Markus Kraft at the
 * University of Cambridge http://como.cheng.cam.ac.uk .
 * An early Fortran code for the simulation of soot formation was developed
 * by Michael Balthasar and Jasdeep Singh amongst others.  Robert Patterson
 * wrote a completely new Fortran code with similar functionality, exploiting
 * the analysis Singh and Balthasar had carried out as they developed from
 * scratch.  Patterson named his new code Sweep after the friend of the
 * cartoon character Sooty, since the purpose of the code was to simulate
 * soot formation.  Matt Celnik developed Sweep into a library for use in larger
 * calculations (Mops) and forked the C++ family of which this code is a part.
