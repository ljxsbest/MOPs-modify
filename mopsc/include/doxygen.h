 * \mainpage Mops
 * Mops is generally referred to as mopsc (to distinguish it from an earlier
 * and now independent Fortran version).
 *
 * \section mopshistory History
 * Mops is part of a larger suite of particle simulation software that
 * has its origins in the research group of Markus Kraft at the
 * University of Cambridge http://como.cheng.cam.ac.uk .
 * Matt Celnik developed Mops in Fortran and later
 * forked the C++ family of which this code is a part.
